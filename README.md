Creating an organization and transfering a repo to it  
was an easy and intuitive process. The ability to transfer a repository  
from your personal GitHub into an organization  
possibly shared with multiple users seems to be very useful for  
better allowing collaboration and teamwork for projects.  
Keeping repositories for a project all in one place  
which to be viewed and edited seems very organized,
and would allow for better collaborative management and visibility.
